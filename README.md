# nibe_s_model_bugs

## What is this for?

This repos is made to keep track of issues / bugs in the Nibe / Vølund SMO S-40 control unit. This unit has been plagued by bugs for more than two years now and Nibe / Vølund does not respond to bug reports and they don't really fix long standing bugs either. 
You are welcome to add bugs / problems you have discovered. Then we can keep track of progress and Nibe's answers here.
